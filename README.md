# Arduino LED Blinking Example

This is a basic Arduino sketch that demonstrates how to blink a LED on and off at regular intervals using digital output and a delay.

## 📋 Description

The code turns an LED on and off every 500 milliseconds (half a second).

## 🛠️ Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
- 1x LED
- 1x 220Ω resistor (recommended)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable to upload code to the Arduino

## 🔌 Circuit Setup

1. Connect the **positive leg (anode)** of the LED to **digital pin 7** on the Arduino.
2. Connect the **negative leg (cathode)** of the LED to one end of the resistor.
3. Connect the other end of the resistor to **GND** on the Arduino.
